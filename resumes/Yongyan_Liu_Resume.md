## RESEARCH INTERESTS

Applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze
large-scale biological datasets for aging research. Broadly interested
in using computational approaches to understand the mechanisms of aging
and develop interventions to improve healthspan and longevity.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Fintopia Group** \hfill 
*Founder* \hfill
Jan 2015 – Present | Singapore

*Founded fintech company providing accessible credit to underserved
populations globally (salaried workers, small business owners, farmers,
rural communities) through AI-driven alternative credit scoring,
operating brands including 洋钱罐借款 (China), Easycash (Indonesia),
Credmex (Mexico), and MabilisCash (Philippines).*

**Scale and Impact:**

-   **Built AI-driven platform serving 184 million users across China,
    Indonesia, Mexico, and Philippines**, processing \$78.2 billion in
    cumulative loan transactions.
-   **Easycash became Indonesia's largest online lending platform** with
    7+ million borrowers and \$3.9 billion in disbursements since 2017,
    providing financial access to traditionally underserved groups
    including farmers and small entrepreneurs.
-   **Partnered with 115+ financial institutions globally**, creating
    ecosystem that has facilitated financial inclusion for millions
    without traditional credit histories.

**AI and Machine Learning Innovation:**

-   **Pioneered deep learning models for credit risk assessment**
    analyzing millions of non-traditional data points per individual
    (behavioral patterns, transaction histories, mobile usage) to
    predict creditworthiness — directly transferable to developing
    prognostic models using multi-modal biomarkers (genomic, clinical,
    lifestyle) for aging and disease risk.
-   **Designed real-time fraud detection system** processing billions of
    transactions annually, using anomaly detection algorithms to
    distinguish normal variation from true fraud with \>95% accuracy.
-   **Implemented NLP pipelines** for automated information extraction
    and classification from unstructured data sources.
-   **Built cross-population machine learning framework** that
    successfully adapted models across four countries with distinct
    demographic, economic, and behavioral characteristics — essential
    for studying aging across diverse genetic backgrounds and
    environmental exposures.

**Leadership and Organizational Growth:**

-   Scaled company from inception to **2,000+ employees including 800+
    data scientists and engineers**; built and led multidisciplinary
    teams across engineering, data science, product, operations, and
    regulatory compliance.
-   Directed international expansion adapting AI systems to different
    regulatory environments and population characteristics; managed
    multiple funding rounds totaling over \$200 million.
-   **Led COVID-19 emergency response in Mexico and Indonesia (2020)**:
    When pandemic created supply chain crisis forcing business closures,
    provided immediate short-term financing to local small businesses
    and entrepreneurs to sustain operations.

**Facebook** \hfill
*Engineering Manager, Payment Platform* \hfill
Mar 2010 – Aug 2014 | Menlo Park, CA

-   **One of four founding engineers** of Facebook Payments team, served as **team architect** building the backbone system through which billions of dollars flow daily today — demonstrating ability to design foundational infrastructure for systems that scale exponentially.
-   **Led Payment Engine project**: Initiated and directed complete 2-year rewrite of entire payments infrastructure (billing and transaction systems), overcoming organizational skepticism to deliver system that remains Meta's payment processing foundation over a decade later.
-   **Scaled payment processing from single-digit billions annually to billions daily**, designing systems that grew with Facebook's explosive growth while maintaining <100ms latency and 99.99% uptime — critical expertise for processing large genomic datasets and building real-time bioinformatics pipelines.
-   **Led 60-member engineering team** across multiple initiatives including Facebook Credits (multi-billion dollar virtual currency), local currency migration, and integration with dozens of payment partners.
-   **Developed algorithmic fraud detection system** analyzing transaction patterns from billions of global transactions, building models to distinguish normal behavioral variation from anomalies — methodology transferable to identifying disease-associated patterns in population health data.
-   **Created "Pay Later" credit scoring system** using machine learning on behavioral data to predict repayment likelihood without traditional credit history — analogous to predicting biological age or disease risk from novel biomarkers.

**Google** \hfill
*Software Engineer & Tech Lead, Product Search* \hfill
Jul 2007 – Mar 2010 | Beijing, China

-   **Led team launching Google Product Search across East Asia** (China, Japan, Korea), developing multilingual NLP framework for cross-language text processing and classification — techniques applicable to analyzing genomic sequences and biomedical literature across international databases.
-   **Co-developed Google Pinyin Input Method Engine** using statistical language models and frequency-based ranking algorithms, achieving **20 million daily active users** (2010).


## RESEARCH PHILOSOPHY & PERSONAL MOTIVATION

As someone who has traveled to over 70 countries and pursues physical
activities with dedication, including skiing across four continents from European
peaks to Andean slopes, scuba diving with 200+ dives exploring marine
ecosystems, and playing golf, I have developed a profound appreciation
for the beauty and resilience of carbon-based life in all its forms.

Witnessing the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence over recent
years, I believe humanity will eventually face a fundamental choice: the
path of silicon-based existence through digital consciousness, or the
continued evolution of our carbon-based biological form. While I respect
the silicon path, I am deeply drawn to preserving and enhancing
carbon-based life. The elegance of biological systems, self-repairing,
adaptable, conscious organisms shaped by billions of years of
evolution, represents something precious worth fighting for.

I view biological systems through a computational lens: DNA and RNA as
information-rich datasets encoding life's instructions, proteins as
functional outputs of genetic programs, cellular processes as
orchestrated algorithms, and aging as accumulated errors in biological
information processing. This perspective, shaped by two decades
developing AI systems that extract meaningful patterns from massive
datasets representing diverse populations, has convinced me that the
same computational approaches revolutionizing technology can unlock the
mysteries of aging.

My career has focused on using machine learning to solve previously
intractable problems, including predicting individual outcomes from complex
multidimensional data, identifying subtle patterns across heterogeneous
populations, and building systems that learn and adapt. These skills are
directly applicable to aging research: analyzing multi-omics data to
identify longevity biomarkers, predicting individual aging trajectories,
and discovering interventions to extend healthspan. I want to use AI not to
replace carbon-based life, but to help it thrive by developing
computational tools that enable us to understand and enhance the
biological processes that make life beautiful, extending not just
lifespan but the quality of our physical existence on this planet.
