Hello! I'm **Yongyan Liu**, a first-year Master's student in Biostatistics at Columbia University. When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me on mountains, underwater, or on the golf course.

### Adventures & Hobbies

**Skiing & Snowboarding** - Semi-Professional

I've been chasing powder since 2010, and it's become more than just a hobby. I've carved turns across four continents—from the resorts of Asia to the peaks of Europe, the Andes of South America, and the legendary slopes of North America. Whether it's fresh powder or groomed runs, I'm equally comfortable on skis or a snowboard.

**Scuba Diving** - Advanced Open Water Diver

With over 200 dives under my belt and a PADI Advanced Open Water license, I've explored underwater worlds that most people only see in documentaries. There's something magical about the weightlessness and tranquility beneath the surface—it's meditation in motion.

**Golf** - Enthusiastic Beginner

Currently playing at a 20 handicap and working to bring it down. Golf teaches patience and humility in ways that no other sport can. Every round is a new challenge, and I'm hooked.
